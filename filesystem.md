# 📝 Cloud IDE File System & Terminal: Plan and Spec

This is a step-by-step plan and technical spec for building a cloud IDE file system and terminal experience that works like Firebase Studio, Project IDX, or Codespaces. It’s written for a semi-amateur developer, with clear explanations and practical steps.

---

## 1. High-Level Architecture

### Frontend (Web IDE)
- User edits files, runs commands, interacts with AI, etc.

### Backend (Per-user Container/VM)
- Runs a real OS (Linux), with a real file system.
- Runs the terminal, language servers, and backend services.
- Syncs files with cloud storage (Firebase, GCS, S3, etc.).

### Cloud Storage
- Source of truth for user files (e.g., Firebase Storage, Firestore).

---

## 2. User Workflow

1. User opens a project in the IDE.
2. A container/VM is provisioned for the user/project.
3. Files are synced from cloud storage to the container’s local file system.
4. User edits files in the IDE.
5. Changes are written to the local file system and synced back to cloud storage.
6. User opens a terminal.
7. Terminal runs inside the container, with access to all files.
8. AI features, CLI tools, and the editor all operate on the same file system.

---

## 3. Technical Spec

### A. Container/VM Management
- Use Docker, Kubernetes, or a cloud VM service to create a container/VM per user/project.
- Each container includes:
  - A Linux OS (e.g., Ubuntu)
  - Node.js, Python, npm, git, etc.
  - Your IDE backend server (OpenSumi, Theia, etc.)

### B. File Sync Layer

**Purpose**: Keep files in sync between cloud storage and the container’s local disk.

**Options**:
- Use an open-source tool (e.g., `rclone`, `mutagen`)
- Or write a custom sync service (Node.js, Go, etc.) that:
  - Downloads all files from cloud storage to a workspace directory on container start.
  - Watches for local file changes and uploads them to cloud storage.
  - Watches for remote changes and downloads them to the local disk.

**Sync Triggers**:
- On project open: full sync.
- On file change (local or remote): incremental sync.

### C. File System Mount Point
- All IDE file operations (read, write, list, etc.) use the local workspace directory in the container.
- The terminal and all CLI tools see the same files.

### D. Terminal Integration
- The IDE frontend connects to a terminal process running inside the container.
- All commands (`ls`, `npm install`, etc.) work as expected.

### E. AI/Language Server Integration
- AI features and language servers run in the container and access files via the local file system.

### F. Cloud Storage API
- Use Firebase Storage, Firestore, or another cloud storage API as the source of truth.
- The sync service uses the API to upload/download files.

## 4. Example Directory Structure

```
/workspace/user123/projectA
```

- This is the local directory in the container, kept in sync with cloud storage.

---

## 5. Example Sync Service (Pseudocode)

```ts
// On container start
downloadAllFromCloud();

// Watch local files
fs.watch('/workspace/projectA', (event, file) => {
  uploadToCloud(file);
});

// Watch cloud changes
watchCloudChanges((file) => {
  downloadToLocal(file);
});
```

---

## 6. Security & Multi-user

- Each user gets an isolated container/VM.
- Only their files are accessible in their environment.
- Containers are destroyed when the session ends (optionally, files are re-synced to cloud).

---

## 7. Scalability

- Use Kubernetes or a similar orchestrator to manage many containers.
- Use auto-scaling to handle more users.

---

## 8. Optional: Real-Time Collaboration

- Use a CRDT or OT-based service (like Firepad, Yjs, or ShareDB) for real-time multi-user editing.
- Still sync to the local file system for terminal/CLI compatibility.

---

## 9. What You Need to Build

- [ ] Container/VM orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- [ ] File sync service (rclone, mutagen, or custom)
- [ ] IDE backend (OpenSumi, Theia, etc.) running in the container
- [ ] Terminal integration (already provided by OpenSumi)
- [ ] Cloud storage API integration (Firebase SDK, etc.)
- [ ] Frontend (OpenSumi, VS Code Web, etc.)

---

## 10. Why This Works (Like Firebase Studio)

- Terminal and AI features work perfectly because they operate on a real file system.
- Cloud storage is always up-to-date thanks to the sync layer.
- User experience is seamless—just like in Firebase Studio, Project IDX, or Codespaces.

## 11. References & Tools

- `rclone` (syncs cloud storage to local disk)
- `mutagen` (real-time file sync)
- Firebase Admin SDK
- OpenSumi Terminal Docs
- Project IDX Architecture
